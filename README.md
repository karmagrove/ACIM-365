ACIM-365
========

ACIM : One lesson for each day of the year.  

The purpose of this app is for me to learn xcode and iOS development as well as create an app so anyone can easily follow along with the 365 daily lessons for a course in miracles.

Version 1.0 Goal

Have all the lessons from 1 to 365 as a page based app where you can swipe between each page.  Save location in memory of last page viewed.  

Version 2.0 Goal

Be able to search for a given page between 1 and 365 by using the phone number type display to easily type a 3 digit number and hit okay.
